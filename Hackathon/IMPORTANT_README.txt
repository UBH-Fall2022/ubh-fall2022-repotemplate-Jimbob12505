IMPORTANT: READ THIS

1. Make sure to run the main.py script while in the same directory as all the other files
2. When running main.py, a GUI will appear with 3 options. OPTION 1 is DEFAULT; this simulates our solar system with prexisting planets. OPTION 2 is CUSTOM; this allows the user to create a custom planet and simulate it
3. I wasn't able to finish option 2 completely. It still works but make sure to put in only 1 planet as your input otherwise it will crash. I'll make sure to work on this in the future
4. When inputting the parameters for the planet in CUSTOM, radius of a planet should be a value between 1 and 50, this is because the system is scaled down
5. When inputting the parameters of the planet in CUSTOM, mass of the planet is in kg. To get the best results I recommend using values greater than or equal to 1*10^19. Enter as a number
6. When inputting the parameters of the planet in CUSTOM, velocity of the planet is in km^-1. The value you enter will be multipied by a 1000 so I recommend values from 10 to 100
7. Note, you can choose whatever numbers you want, the above values are just recommendations.
